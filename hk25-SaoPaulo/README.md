# São Paulo Node: research topics (hk25-SaoPaulo):

The São Paulo node has proposed ten key research topics, focusing on significant atmospheric phenomena in South America. Our primary goal is to utilize high-resolution climate simulations to investigate and gain a deeper understanding of these critical areas. We aim to analyze global climate models through a regional lens, concentrating specifically on our continent. This approach will leverage existing tools, methodologies, and datasets to gain valuable insights.

### Topics: 
- [Simulation Verification](https://github.com/salvatirehbein/hk25-teams/blob/main/hk25-SaoPaulo/tp_verification_stats.md)
  
- **Model Performance in Complex Regions**: Assess simulation results in areas where models typically struggle. Example regions: Andes, Eastern Amazon.

- **Seasonality Analysis**: Define boxes in selected regions to assess the seasonality of key variables. Since the focus is on high resolution, consider regionalizing areas such as metropolitan regions.

- **Diurnal Cycle**: Use regional or sub-regional boxes (e.g., from IPCC regions) to analyze the diurnal cycle of variables.

- **EOF (Empirical Orthogonal Functions) for climate modes**: Not applicable, as only one year of data is available.

- **Monsoon Analysis**: Plot precipitation vs. month in the monsoon region to evaluate seasonal patterns.

- **SACZ (South Atlantic Convergence Zone)**: Create seasonal climatology to assess average position and intensity. Not enough data for climatology.

- **Simulation Comparisons**: Compare different simulations, models, and physical parameterizations.

- **Case Studies**: Analyze specific events such as cyclones, MCSs, etc. See GrEC`s table.

- **Extremes Analysis**: Investigate precipitation and temperature extremes.
