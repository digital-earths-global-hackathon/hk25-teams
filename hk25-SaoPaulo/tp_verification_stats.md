## Simulation Verification
The initial analysis should focus on the fundamentals, utilizing well-known statistical metrics to verify the accuracy and reliability of the simulations. These metrics serve as the foundation for evaluating the model's performance and understanding its strengths and limitations. 

Suggested [observational datasets](https://github.com/salvatirehbein/hk25-teams/blob/main/hk25-SaoPaulo/tp_datasets.md) are available for the verifications. These datasets will be essential for assessing the accuracy of the simulations and providing a comprehensive comparison with real-world data.
