# AI Representations with NVIDIA (hk25-NVIDIA)

NVIDIA has been exploring the use of AI to improve the workflows associated with km-scale models.  For the Hackathon they have developed a prototype emulator allows massive compression of km-scale data, which then can provide a platofrm for accelerated analysis.

In this cross-cutting activity we will evaluate the capabilities and limitations of the emulator, and its ability to learn differences amond km-scale models. 

**Note** Participants are asked to register for the team as early as possible so the varied skill levels can be evalauted and approrpiate activities defined. 

**Coordination**: Noah Brenowitz (nbrenowitz@nvidia.com)

#### Sketch of initial activities:
* extend AI training to additional models hosted on NERSC mode
* scale out the AI traning to other hackathon nodes and models
* test inference of model trained on an earlier version of ICON and ERA5
