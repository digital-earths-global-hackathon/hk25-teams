# Shallow circulations in the ITCZ (hk25-ShallowCirc)

The intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) in the eastern parts of the Pacific and Atlantic basins is dominated by bottom-heavy or shallow meridional circulations, with outflow observed at 2-4 km. In this team, we would like to understand the dynamical drivers of shallow meridional circulations as a function of the seasonal cycle using storm resolving simulations. We are interested in characterising the surface and free troposphere controls on the depth of the shallow circulations and testing the hypothesis that the circulation becomes more pronounced as the ITCZ moves poleward.

#### Sketch of initial activities
* construct the meridional overturning circulation in the eastern Atlantic and Pacific ITCZ
* compute zonal and meridional momentum budgets across pressure levels
* determine the seasonal cycle of the depth of the outflow
