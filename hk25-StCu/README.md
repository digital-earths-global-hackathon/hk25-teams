# Mesoscale structure of stratocumulus (hk25-StCu)

Low-level clouds over subtropical oceans are important for the energy balance of the planet and climate sensitivity. Their properties and evolution crucially depend on small scale processes. A recent examination of their climatology ([Nowak et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024MS004340)) in two [NextGEMS](https://nextgems-h2020.eu/) global storm-resolving models indicated realistic covariability of stratocumulus and related environmental factors, and the vertical structure of the boundary layer. How is that possible without elaborated model tuning and on the grid which is too large to resolve large turbulent eddies? 

It was speculated that the km-scale grid allows to simulate mesoscale circulations which might be sufficient to crudely represent the radiation-turbulence-entrainment-flux feedback regulating the behavior of stratocumuli. We would like to test this hypothesis by inspecting the mesoscale patterns of cloudiness, circulation and precipitation in the models and check whether those patterns comply with the mechanisms proposed to explain the cellular cloud structures evident in observations (see e.g. [Comstock et al. 2005](https://doi.org/10.1175/JAS3567.1), [van Zanten and Stevens 2005](https://doi.org/10.1175/JAS3611.1), [Wood et al. 2011](https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-11-2341-2011)).

#### Sketch of initial activities
* Extract snapshots of subtropical stratocumulus fields
* Asses qualitatively whether the mesoscale cloud patterns are cellular
* Quantify their organization with a chosen statistical metric
* Examine the co-variability of clouds, circulation and precipitation
