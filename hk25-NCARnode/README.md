# Science break-out groups at the NSF NCAR node

The NCAR node has seven break-out topics that participants can focus on during the Hackathon week.
Each break-out topic will be lead by one of the participants.

The seven **science topics** are: 

* Storm tracking and development of atmospheric convection
* Cloud microphysics 
* Land-atmosphere interactions 
* Extreme weather events 
* Mesoscale circulations
* Diurnal cycle
* General circulation & upscale effects

This repository contains subfolders for each of the science groups that collect their notebooks and scripts to address research questions using the WCRP Hackathon global and regional datasets.

The additional subfolders contain...

    /basics/ Example notebooks how to read in and make basics plot using the NCAR-hosted datasets

    /observations/  Example notebooks to access observational datasets on NCAR's glade system that can be used for model evaluation

    /uxarray/ Examples on how to work with unstructured grids using **uxarray**
