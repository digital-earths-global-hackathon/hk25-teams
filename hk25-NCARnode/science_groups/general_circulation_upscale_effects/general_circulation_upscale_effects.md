# General circulation and upscale effects


This group will focus on science questions related to the general large-scale atmospheric circulation and upscale effects
on mesoscale weather systems on the latter. Potential themes to focus on include the Hadley Circulation, Lorenz energy cycle, and the effects of weather systems and deep convection on the upper-level wind circulation and jetstreams.
