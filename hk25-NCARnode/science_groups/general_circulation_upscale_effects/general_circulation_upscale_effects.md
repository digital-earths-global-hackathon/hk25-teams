# General circulation and upscale effects


This group will focus on science questions related to the general large-scale atmospheric circulation and upscale effects
on mesoscale weather systems on the latter. Potential themes to focus on include the Hadley Circulation, Lorenz energy cycle, and the effects of weather systems and deep convection on the upper-level wind circulation and jetstreams. 

**Coordination**: Alexander Lojko (Alojko@ucar.edu)

Sketch of initial activities:

General circulation and upscale effects. Focus would be on the mid-latitudes. Notably how mesoscale convective systems and warm conveyor belts interact with the mid latitude flow focusing on using a potential vorticity perspective. Some more simple analysis tools such as using kinetic energy spectra, hovmollers and dry vorticity can also be leveraged for understanding of how small scale weather systems interact with the large scale flow. Some of this analysis can be provided from my Python notebooks.
