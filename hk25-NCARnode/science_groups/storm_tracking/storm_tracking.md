# Storm tracking


This group will focus on tracking convective storms to study the evolution of atmospheric convection in global and regional km-scale model simulations.

The output of various storm trackers that track **Meso-scale convective systems** using different global km-scale datasets is available at https://github.com/digital-earths-global-hackathon/hk25-teams/tree/main/hk25-MCS.
