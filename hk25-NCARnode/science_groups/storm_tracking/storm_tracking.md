# Storm tracking


This group will focus on tracking convective storms to study the evolution of atmospheric convection in global and regional km-scale model simulations.

The output of various storm trackers that track **Meso-scale convective systems** using different global km-scale datasets is available at https://github.com/digital-earths-global-hackathon/hk25-teams/tree/main/hk25-MCS. 

**Coordination**: Julia Kukulies  (kukulies@ucar.edu), Abby Jaye (jaye@ucar.edu)

Sketch of initial activities:

A goal for the storm tracking and development of convection group would be to quantify main differences in some storm/convection characteristics over the US in regional vs. global simulations.
