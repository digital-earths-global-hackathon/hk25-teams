# Cloud microphysics

Cloud microphysics remain a major uncertainty in km-scale climate models and dependent on the microphysical parametrization, its effects on other atmospheric variables could vary. This group focuses on science questions related to cloud microphysics, including cloud radiative effects, cloud-convection interactions, aerosol-cloud interactions, precipitation formation and efficiency as well the evaluation of different microphysical schemes.
