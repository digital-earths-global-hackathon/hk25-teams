# Meso-scale circulations

This group will focus on meso-scale circulations, including for example land-sea breezes.

Sketch of initial activities:

In the tropics, convection plays an important role in modulating
large-scale dynamics, being an integral component of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO). Convective aggregation (CA) or spontaneous conversion of isolated to aggregated patchy convection is thought to play a role in the evolution of MJO. One of the ingredients required for CA of shallow cloud fields, especially over open ocean, is the presence of mesoscale convergence zones. Land breeze forced by islands within MC that propagate over long distances over the open ocean can provide such forcing that triggers CA.

The main focus of this initiative is to examine the ability of different km-scale models to simulate the initiation of deep convection, triggered by land-breezes and collisions between land breezes, especially in the Maritime Continent MC.
