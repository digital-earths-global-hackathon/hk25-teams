# Land-atmosphere interactions


This group focuses on land-atmosphere interactions such as the impact of soil moisture on precipitation. A common applicationtion of km-scale climate model data, especially of regional datasets that are able to capture realistic weather patterns (such as the CONUS404 dataset), are hydrological applications. 

**Coordination**: Erin Dougherty (doughert@ucar.edu)

Sketch of initial activities:

I'm interested in leading the hydrology breakout group on showing how to use the data to run hydrologic models. However, I need to contact people from the WRF-Hydro team to see if we can do this in a tractable way for the workshop, as this is usually quite time-consuming.
