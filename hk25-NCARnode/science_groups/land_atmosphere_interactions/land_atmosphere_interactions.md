# Land-atmosphere interactions


This group focuses on land-atmosphere interactions such as the impact of soil moisture on precipitation. A common applicationtion of km-scale climate model data, especially of regional datasets that are able to capture realistic weather patterns (such as the CONUS404 dataset), are hydrological applications.
