# Energetics of Tropical Rainbelts  (hk25-RainBelt)

Global km-scale grids permits an explicit representation of convective storms and the processes they entails. Over the tropical ocean, precipitation occurs in a variety of environments. Precipitating regions could be related to strong sea surface temperature gradients and a bottom-heavy circulation (e.g., Eastern Pacific) or a top-heavy circulation, weak SST gradients, and light winds (e.g., Western Pacific). Due to the diversity of pathways in which precipitation occurs, we will analyze how convection is represented across the tropical oceans in the different participating km-scale models using an energetic-moisture framework.

#### Sketch of initial activities
* identify the tropical rainbelt
* calculate the entropy forcing and the net precipitation flux at the surface
* compute the type of circulation (top- or bottom-heavy) in the tropical rainbelt
* extract the spectrum of convective coupled equatorial waves
