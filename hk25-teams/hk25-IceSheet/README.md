# Precipitation over ice-sheets (hk25-IceSheet)

Mass loss of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets is an important contributor for current and future sea level rise. To properly drive the surface mass balance calculations in ice sheet models, a realistic simulation of precipitation and surface temperatures is crucial. Regional modeling studies suggest that higher resolution of the atmospheric models driving ice sheet models improves the simulation of processes occurring at the steep margins of the ice sheets, making km-scale global models a promising tool for future coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice sheet modelling as planned for example in the [TerraDT](https://terradt.eu/) project.

In this team we want to compare the simulated surface meteorology over Greenland and Antarctica for participating models and with reanalysis data and observations to assess how suited the models are to drive ice-sheet models.

#### Sketch of initial activities:
*	extract model output for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets
*	produce precipitation and temperature maps
*	compare annual cycles for regional means and selected locations
