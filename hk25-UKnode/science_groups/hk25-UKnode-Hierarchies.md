# Exploiting a global to regional model hierarchy to assess role of domain extent, model physics and grid spacing on representation of key processes 

This science team will evaluate the characteristics of a traceable hierarchy of model simulations including global 10km, global 5km, tropical cyclic channel and limited area models at higher resolution using a range of model physics to understand the relative impact of domain extent, physics and resolution on key climate variables including precipitation, clouds and radiation. Analysis will focus on key regions of interest, utilising the availability of limited area models across South America, Africa and South East Asia domains as regional model benchmarks.

## Sketch of initial activities

- Examine the time-mean basic state of key model variables, making direct comparisons across the model hierarchy.
- Examine the time evolution, from diurnal to seasonal cycles and characteristics of model variables of interest, exploring their sensitivity to model choices.
- Examine the representation of high impact weather during the year-long simulation period across the model hierarchy.
- Examine the extent to which domain extent, choice of physics, or grid spacing drive particular model behaviour.
- In connection with hk25-UKnode-Upscale, exploit the model hierarchy to explore evidence for emergence of new model behaviour (e.g. upscale feedbacks) in higher resolution global or tropical channel simulations. 

Note this has strong links with hk25-UKnode-Upscale as well as other international groups with interest on specific variables/processes which can be assessed across a model hierarchy.
