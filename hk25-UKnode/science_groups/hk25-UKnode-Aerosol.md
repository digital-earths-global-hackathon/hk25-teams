# Km-scale representation of aerosol transport and interaction with radiation and clouds

This science team will assess the representation of aerosol transport and interaction with radiation and clouds. The team will analyze a year-long, km-scale simulation with interactive aerosols. The aerosols are represented with four modes with prescribed sizes and compositions, i.e., dust, sea salt, carbonaceous aerosol, and sulfuric aerosol. The four modes are transported through the atmosphere and are coupled with various processes such as radiation, convection, and precipitation.

## Sketch of initial activities

- Examine the annual cycle of dust emissions driven by moist convection
- Examine the transport of dust, smoke, and moisture in the West-African monsoon region
- Examine the representation of the Asian Tropopause Aerosol Layer and long-range transport of pollutants from the Indo-Gangetic Plain
- Examine the small-scale transport of boreal fire smoke in the Arctic region
- Examine the influence of aerosols on the organisation of mesoscale convective systems
