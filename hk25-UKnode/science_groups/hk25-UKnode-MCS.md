# MCSs

This group will investigate the representation of MCSs in km-scale models, looking at statistics, structure, and environments under which MCSs form. 

**Coodination**: Mark Muetzelfeldt (mark.muetzelfeldt@reading.ac.uk), Torsten Auerswald (t.auerswald@reading.ac.uk)

## Sketch of initial activities:

* Analyse tracks produced from the global simulation(s)
* Compare different tracking algorithms (PyFLEXTRKR, simple-track, tobac...)
* Produce statistics of MCS activity in simulations
* Analyse environments under which MCSs form in simulations
