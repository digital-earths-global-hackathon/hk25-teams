# Hunting for evidence of upscale feedbacks from small scales (convection) to large scales (global circulations)

This science team will assess the influence of convection on larger scales and the climate state within km-scale models. It has been suggested that by explicitly representing convection in km-scale global (or sufficientky large domain) models, that small scales can feedback and impact on the general circulation, and thereby reduce some long-standing model biases. It can however be challenging to unpick the impact of increasing model resolution between well-known 'dynamical downscaling' improvements that can be anticipated through reduced grid spacing and resolving more geographical features etc, rather than unlocking representation of new processes. This small-to-large scale interaction is not currently simulated in global models with grid spacing of order 10 km or greater, in which the influence of convection is parametrized, or in nested limited-area models in which smaller scales do not feedback onto the general circulation.

## Sketch of initial activities

- Consider different process-based diagnostic approaches to assess evidence of upscale interactions in models.
- Explore metrics to derive new insights on upscale feedbacks in km-scale models

Note this activity is closely linked to hk25-UKnode-Hierarchies given likelihood of utilising global-regional model hierarchies to assess upscale feedbacks.
This is also aligned with hk25-InterScale international activity.
