# Destination Earth with ClimateDT Consortium (hk25-DestinE)

[DestinE](https://destination-earth.eu) is an initiative of the European Commission which includes the operationalization of multi-decadal climate simulations using km-scale global models. Several multi-decadal scenario simulations have been performed with the [Climate Change Adaptation Digital Twin](https://destine.ecmwf.int/climate-change-adaptation-digital-twin-climate-dt/#What-is-the-Climate-DT) and are being integrated into the DestinE platform. Models underlying the Climate DT are ICON, IFS-NEMO, and [IFS-FESOM](https://github.com/digital-earths-global-hackathon/hk25/blob/main/content/models/ifs.md).

In this cross-cutting activity, we will exploit DestinE runs for new scientific insights via the [DestinE data platform (DESP)](https://platform.destine.eu). One of the goals is to expand the scope of the scientific analyses being performed by the HK25 science teams using the multi-decadal km-scale simulations of the Climate DT. The longer-term simulations may allow answering how a particular process identified by the other science teams might change under global warming. We can also address how much of a recent observed extreme event can be attributed to the already realised climate change, or how the exact event might have unfolded in an even warmer climate (using DestinE's so-called storyline simulations).

**Note**: Upgraded access to the DestinE data platform is required for eligible participants in the Hackathon. Those wishing to gain access need to register by 2 May (via https://platform.destine.eu/access-policy-upgrade/), and abide by the DestinE data policies.

**2nd Note**: For information on the shorter global hackathon simulations with IFS-FESOM at 2.8km global resolution, please refer [to this page](https://github.com/digital-earths-global-hackathon/hk25/blob/main/content/models/ifs.md).

#### Sketch of initial activities:
* Gain access to the DestinE platform
* Identify analyses from science teams that could be executed on that platform and/or extended in scope using longer-term scenario simulations
* Perform analyses and compare to other Hackathon models

#### Start here:
It is a good idea to start from our [short introduction](intro/introduction.md), which answers many frequent questions on how to access the DestinE data via DESP.
