# Destination Earth with ClimateDT Consortium (hk25-DestinE)

[DestineE](https://destination-earth.eu) is an initiative of the European Commission which includes the operationalization of multi-decadal climate simulations using km-scale global models. Several multi-decadal scenario simulations have been performed with the [Climate Change Adaptation Digital Twin](https://destine.ecmwf.int/climate-change-adaptation-digital-twin-climate-dt/#What-is-the-Climate-DT) and are being integrated into the DestinE platform.

In this cross-cutting activity we will adopt and expand the analyses of different science teams to the DestinE data. One of the goals of this activity is to experiment with the capabilities of the [DestinE data platform](https://platform.destine.eu). Another goal is to expand the scope of the scientific analysis being performed by the science teams using the multi-decadal km-scale simulations of ClimateDT.

**Note** Upgraded access to the DestinE data platform is required for eligible participants in the Hackathon. Those wishing to gain access need to register by 2 May (via https://platform.destine.eu/access-policy-upgrade/), and abide by the DestinE data policies.

**Coordination**: Tracy Kiszler (theresa.kiszler@csc.fi), **Co-coordination**: Thomas Rackow (thomas.rackow@ecmwf.int)

#### Sketch of initial activities:
* gain access to the DestinE platform
* identify analyses from science teams that could be executed on that platform.
* perform analyses and compare to Hackathon models
