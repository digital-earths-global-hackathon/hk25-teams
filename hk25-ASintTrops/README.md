# Air-sea interaction in the tropics (hk25-ASintTrops)

This activity is motivated by several open questions on how the tropical boundary layer and moist convection interact with the underlying ocean on scales 2 km - 200 km. For instance, how does the tropical atmosphere respond to SST heterogeneity at those scales? What sets air-sea interaction at low versus high wind speeds, or how do precipitation or cloudiness impact air-sea fluxes and the ocean mixed-layer?

In this team we want to analyze relationships between SST, air-sea fluxes, tropical convection and the ocean mixed at (sub)mesoscales, using those participating models that run a coupled ocean-atmosphere simulation.

First activities may include:
* Analyze air-sea heat fluxes and wind stress as a function of SST, stability and wind speed
* Derive divergence and curl of wind speed and stress across SST gradients
* Derive coupling coefficients to evaluate the atmospheric feedback on wind (stress)
* Analyze mixed-layer depth as a function of air-sea fluxes and wind speed
* Composite air-sea fluxes as a function of cloud cover, radiation and precipitation
