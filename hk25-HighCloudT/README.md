# High Cloud Top Temperatures (hk25-HighCloudT)

Because of their altitude, convective high clouds dominate outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) by setting the emission temperature, such that $OLR \approx \sigma T_{hc}^4$, with $T_{hc}$ the high cloud top temperature. This expression, combined with the theory that high clouds worldwide have a characteristic emission temperature that remains unchanging with surface warming (the Fixed Anvil Temperature hypothesis; Hartmann et al., 2002; Thompson et al., 2017), suggests that constraining $T_{hc}$ can lead to better estimates of the longwave high cloud feedback parameter and thus climate sensitivity.

In this group, we will examine high cloud top temperatures in storm resolving models. We will identify gridcells fully spanned by high clouds and invert the allsky OLR for emission temperature, then construct latitudinally-resolved temperature distributions. Using these distributions, we can test the effectiveness of simple expressions in capturing the high cloud radiative effect (e.g., Corti and Peter, 2009; Jeevanjee 2023; Deutloff et al., 2025) and, assuming they are unchanging with warming, work towards deriving the longwave cloud feedback parameter.

#### Sketch of Initial Activities
- Identify high cloud top temperatures (in the simplest case, by inverting $\sigma T^4 = OLR_{allsky}$ in gridcells where cloud area fraction $f = 1$ and ice content $> 10^{-1}$ kg m<sup>2</sup>)
- Plot and analyze distributions in space and time
- Compare between models, observations, +4K simulations.
