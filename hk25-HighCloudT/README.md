# High Cloud Top Temperatures (hk25-HighCloudT)

Despite decades of study, estimates of climate sensitivity (the ratio of the forcing, eg., an increase in greenhouse gas concentration, to the feedbacks, or responses to surface warming) have remained roughly constant with only modest reductions of confidence bounds. This uncertainty is dominated by cloud feedbacks, quantified by how cloud changes in response to surface warming modulate the top-of-atmosphere energy balance (Sherwood et al., 2015, 2020; Forster et al., 2021). Because of their altitude, convective high clouds dominate outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) by setting the emission temperature, such that $OLR \approx \sigma T_{hc}^4$, with $T_{hc}$ the high cloud top temperature. This expression, combined with the theory that high clouds worldwide have a characteristic emission temperature that remains unchanging with surface warming (the Fixed Anvil Temperature hypothesis; Hartmann et al., 2002; Thompson et al., 2017), suggests that constraining $T_{hc}$ can lead to better estimates of the longwave high cloud feedback parameter and thus climate sensitivity.

In this group, we will examine high cloud top temperatures primarily in the GFDL model X-SHiELD. We will identify gridcells fully spanned by high clouds and invert the allsky OLR for emission temperature, then construct latitudinally-resolved temperature distributions. Using these distributions, we can test the effectiveness of simple expressions in capturing the high cloud radiative effect (e.g., Corti and Peter, 2009; Jeevanjee 2023; Deutloff et al., 2025) and, assuming they are unchanging with warming, work towards deriving the longwave cloud feedback parameter.

**Sketch of Initial Activities**
- Identify high cloud top temperatures in X-SHiELD (in the simplest case, by inverting $\sigma T^4 = OLR_{allsky}$ in gridcells where cloud area fraction $f = 1$ and ice content $> 10^{-1}$ kg m<sup>2</sup>)
- Plot and analyze distributions in space and time 
- Time permitting/with collaboration from other nodes: compare to other models, observations, +4K simulations.
