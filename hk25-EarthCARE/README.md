# Joint EarthCARE analysis (hk25-EarthCare)

ESA's [EarthCARE] (https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/earthcare) --- the Cloud, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer, is a satellite jointly developed by ESA and JAXA and is the sixth mission choosen as part of ESA's Earth Explorer Programme.   It was launched on 28 May 2024, and will be completing its first year in orbit at the time of the Hackathon.  Its four instruments (ATLID, CPR, MSI, BBR) have unusual capabilities for measuring clouds, aerosols, and radiation.

In this team we will analyze both EarthCARE data and the participating models along virtual EarthCARE swaths, with an initial focus on tropical deep convection as analyzed by EarthCARE, aircraft, ships and ground stations during the [ORCESTRA campaign](http://orcestra-campaign.org/), i.e., over the Tropical Atlantic in the time-period between 10 August and 30 September.

#### Sketch of initial activities:
* extract model output along selected orbit frames
* post-process output using model simulators
* extract analagous EarthCARE frames and data from reanalyses
* perform composit analysis of various quantities
