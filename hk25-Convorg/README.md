# Convective organization and Thermodynamic-convection coupling (hk25-Convorg)

Convective organization is one of important features especially in the tropics over a wide range of spatio-temporal scales. Organized convection interacts with meso-to-synoptic-scale environments and is coupled to large-scale circulations, affecting both weather and climate across the globe. Although global km-scale climate models can represent convective processes more explicitly than conventional climate models, they are expected to struggle with the realistic simulation of convective organization and associated thermodynamic-convection coupling because of unresolved or underresolved processes even with km-scale grid spacing (e.g., microphysics and turbulent mixing).

In this team, we compare the characteristics of mesoscale organized convection, thermodynamic evolution in the life cycle of deep convection, and related weather/climate phenomena simulated in many global storm-resolving models, which have different physics configurations. We also aim at providing helpful insights about the km-scale model development.

## Sketch of initial activities:

+ Quantify precipitation characteristics such as intensity, size, and duration
+ Analyze the thermodynamic evolution associated with deep convection (e.g., buoyancy variations and their decomposition in terms of q and T)
+ Examine the reproducibility of several convection-related phenomena (e.g., tropical waves, MJO, precipitation diurnal cycle)
