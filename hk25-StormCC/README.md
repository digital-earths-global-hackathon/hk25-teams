# STORMS under Climate Change (hk25-STORMCC)

Kilometer-scale climate models offer new opportunities to better understand drivers
of near-surface winds and their effects under both present-day climate condition and
in a warmer world. For the hackathon, our team will explore near-surface wind
statistics from (3-)hourly output of the new climate model simulations. Obtained
results for the present-day climatology of the winds will be compared against other
data sets, e.g., ERA5 reanalysis. StormCC will also use the new climate model output
to investigate the changes in the distributions of (3-)hourly near-surface winds
with warming. A comparison will be made against output from experiments with
coarser-resolution climate models as used in CMIP. Characteristics of near-surface
winds for different seasons and times of day will be assessed and related to the
classical understanding of processes in atmospheric dynamics. Such processes can be
addressed with hourly data in near-surface winds and will be studied in regional
domains of interest, e.g., Northern Africa for the link of winds to dust emission or
storm track regions for changes in peak winds associated with cyclones. 

### We aim to:
- Compute the surface wind climatology from kilometer-scale climate model output
over global and regional domains.
- Assess the global dust uplift potential based on surface wind characteristics.
- Analyze the diurnal cycle of winds in regions of interest
- Compare model results with other datasets such as observations, reanalysis and
CMIP.
