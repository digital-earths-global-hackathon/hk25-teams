storm_icon_o.py: Python module containing core utility functions used throughout the storm detection and tracking process.

Storm_detect.py/Storm_detect_ERA5.py: Code for the detection of storms given a series of mean sea level pressure maps.

Storm_track.ipynb: Code for the tracking of storms after detection has been performed.

Storm_plot.ipynb: Code for plotting storm tracks.

Storm_intensity_frequency_plot.ipynb: Code for plotting spatial maps of storm intensity and occurrence frequency.

This workflow is adapted from the method developed by Eric C. J. Oliver (Department of Oceanography, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada), with modifications for application to ICON and ERA5 datasets, available at: https://github.com/ecjoliver/stormTracking.
